Hi there,

Welcome to my Github profile! My name is Lawson and I am a software developer who loves to create, experiment, and explore.

Some of my favorite hobbies include:

Building robots with Raspberry Pi 🤖
Taking stunning photos 📸
Traveling the world and experiencing new cultures 🌍
I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. So, if you have a cool project that you would like to collaborate on, let's talk! 😎

Thank you for visiting my profile. I hope you enjoy my projects and I can't wait to see what we can create together. 🚀
